# 0. Port (integer). Default 8123.
# 1. Server IP (string).
# 2. Server timeout in ms (int). Default 1500.
# 3. Send reports every N seconds (0: never) (int).
# 4. SSID (str).
# 5. Password (str).
# Use empty string ('') in  SSID and PW to only connect to the WLAN which the
# ESP8266 already "knows".
# If Port or Timeout are changed, these values must be passed to server.run()
